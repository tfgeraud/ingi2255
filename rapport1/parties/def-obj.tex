\subsection{AvailabilityMessage}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
Explanation & Domain Hypothesis\\ \hline
Never Used
&  Messages are always assumed to be delivered in order of sending, without any being lost or corrupted. Delay is assumed to be not significant. \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}


\subsection{\og AVLS \fg}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
Explanation & Domain Hypothesis\\ \hline
Physical object tracking the spatial position of the ambulance
&  Every ambulance has a fixed GPS inside \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}


\subsection{AVLSMessage}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
Explanation & Domain Hypothesis\\ \hline
Message giving the current position of the ambulance through the AVLS
& Messages are always assumed to be delivered in order of sending, without any being lost or corrupted Delay is assumed to be not significant. \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}


\subsection{Call}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
Explanation & Domain Hypothesis\\ \hline
Communication between the witness and the First Line Answerer through which the information about the incident is given.
& The call is assumed to always be completed and valid.  Duplicate calls for the same incident are assumed to be non-existant.  The information given through a call is assumed to be accurate and complete. \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}


\subsection{Incident}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
Explanation & Domain Hypothesis\\ \hline
Situation potentially dangerous for a victim, linked to a physical location.
& The incident is assumed to always threaten only one victim.  The location is assumed to always be reachable by an ambulance.  The situation is assumed to be stable from the time the incident happens to the time the ambulance crew provide the medical care. \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}


\subsection{IncidentInfo}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
Explanation & Domain Hypothesis\\ \hline
Tracking object maintaining information about the physical incident.
& As soon as the information is entered in the CAD concerning an incident, it is assumed to be complete and accurate.  Since the incident is assumed to be stable from the time the call is made to the time the medical care is given, the information used by the system is always valid. \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}


\subsection{\og MDT \fg}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
Explanation & Domain Hypothesis\\ \hline
Mobile Data Terminal, small screen with a keyboard connected through a wireless link to the Computer Aided Despatch System (CAD) installed in every ambulance.
& The MDT is assumed to always be working and connected to the CAD \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}


\subsection{MDTMessage}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
Explanation & Domain Hypothesis\\ \hline
"Physical" transport of the information from the MDT screen to the user.
& Messages are always assumed to be delivered in order of sending, without any being lost or corrupted. Delay is assumed to be not significant. \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}


\subsection{Medicalized}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
Explanation & Domain Hypothesis\\ \hline
Specialised ambulance for highly critical incidents.
& The kind of an ambulance is fixed and cannot change during the lifecycle of the software \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}


\subsection{MobilizationOrder}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
Explanation & Domain Hypothesis\\ \hline
Information sent to the ambulance crew concerning an incident. 
& Messages are always assumed to be delivered in order of sending, without any being lost or corrupted. Delay is assumed to be not significant. \\ \hline

\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Normal}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
Explanation & Domain Hypothesis\\ \hline
Regular ambulance equipped for most situations
& The kind of an ambulance is fixed and cannot change during the lifecycle of the software \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}


\subsection{\og Victim \fg}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
Explanation & Domain Hypothesis\\ \hline
Person being incommodated and/or injured due to an incident.  The person is unable to help himself/herself and need external help.
& The victim is always assumed to be different from the witness.  An incident always concerns only one victim.  Medical care needed involves always only one ambulance crew. \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}


\subsection{\og Witness \fg}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
Explanation & Domain Hypothesis\\ \hline
Person who witness the incident and call the system and talk to the FirstLineAnswerer
